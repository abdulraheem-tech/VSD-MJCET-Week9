# VSD-MJCET-Week9 BabySoC Front End Design and Physical Design 

BabySoC (VSDBabySoC) is a tiny RISC‑V based mixed‑signal SoC that integrates three main IPs—a RISC‑V core (RVMYTH), a PLL, and a DAC—wrapped in a simple top module to demonstrate end‑to‑end front‑end and physical design on an open‑source style flow. At a high level, front‑end design covers architecture, RTL and logical integration, while physical design takes the synthesized netlist through floorplan, placement, CTS, routing and sign‑off to GDS.​

BabySoC front-end design
Architecture: BabySoC targets a simple SoC architecture where the RVMYTH RISC‑V core executes code from its instruction memory, a PLL generates the internal high‑frequency clock from an external reference, and a DAC converts core‑generated digital data (e.g., in register r17) to an analog output.​

IP integration: The three IP blocks (PLL, CPU, DAC) are instantiated in a top‑level wrapper (vsdbabysoc) with well‑defined interfaces for clocks, resets, data and control, forming a minimal SoC test vehicle for multi‑IP integration.​

RTL and simulation: The SoC behavior is described in RTL (Verilog/SystemVerilog) and validated with testbenches to ensure correct instruction execution, clocking behavior and DAC output generation before synthesis.​

Synthesis: RTL is synthesized into a gate‑level netlist targeting a specific technology library, honoring timing, area and power constraints so that the physical design step starts from a clean, timing‑driven netlist.​

BabySoC physical design theory
Inputs and goal: Physical design takes as input the synthesized BabySoC netlist, technology and library files, constraints (timing, power, floorplan), and produces a manufacturable layout database (typically GDSII/OASIS) ready for fabrication.​

Floorplanning: The core area and aspect ratio are defined; the PLL, RVMYTH core and DAC macros are placed, IO pins are assigned, and power planning (power grid, rings, straps) is done to ensure proper IR and electromigration margins.​

Placement and optimization: Standard cells are placed and optimized for timing, congestion and power, while maintaining legal placement and honoring design rules; early static timing analysis uses ideal clocks at this stage.​

Clock tree synthesis (CTS): A clock tree is built from the PLL or pad‑driven clock source to sequential elements in the CPU and other logic, minimizing skew and insertion delay to meet setup/hold constraints.​

Routing and sign‑off: Global and detailed routing connect all nets; then filler and decap cells are inserted, metal fill is applied, and final timing, power, signal‑integrity, and physical verification checks (DRC/LVS) are run before streaming out GDS for tapeout

This document presents the complete physical design implementation of the BabySoC using OpenROAD, covering all stages from floorplanning to post-route parasitic extraction (SPEF generation). The objective of this task is to integrate the theoretical and practical aspects of digital design by executing a full RTL-to-GDSII flow on a real System-on-Chip (SoC).Comprehensive screenshots, step-by-step procedures, and observations are documented to demonstrate the design flow, tools used, challenges encountered, and verification results.

Through this exercise, the BabySoC design undergoes floorplan definition, standard cell placement, routing, and parasitic extraction to reflect a realistic ASIC design process. Each stage is explored to understand how physical parameters—such as floorplan constraints, placement density, and routing topology—affect timing performance and design closure.

The outcome of this work is a fully placed and routed BabySoC layout, accompanied by a generated SPEF file that enables post-route Static Timing Analysis (STA). This provides insight into how parasitic effects influence signal delay and how accurate timing verification is performed in professional VLSI design environments.

### TLV to Verilog Conversion for RVMYTH

Initially, you will see only the `rvmyth.tlv` file inside `src/module/`, since the RVMYTH core is written in TL-Verilog.

<img width="734" height="217" alt="image" src="2.png" />

To convert it into a `.v` file for simulation, follow the steps below:

<strong>🔧 TLV to Verilog Conversion Steps</strong>

```bash
# Step 1: Install python3-venv (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip
```

<img width="1217" height="662" alt="image" src="3.png" />

```
# Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment
cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
python3 -m venv sp_env
source sp_env/bin/activate
```

<img width="1215" height="423" alt="image" src="4.png" />

```
# Step 3: Install SandPiper-SaaS inside the virtual environment
pip install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
```

<img width="1212" height="390" alt="image" src="5.png" />

```
# Step 4: Convert rvmyth.tlv to Verilog
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/
```

<img width="1215" height="331" alt="image" src="6.png" />

✅ After running the above command, rvmyth.v will be generated in the src/module/ directory.

You can confirm this by listing the files:

<img width="739" height="284" alt="image" src="7.png" />

#### Note 
To use this environment in future sessions, always activate it first:
```bash
source sp_env/bin/activate
```
To exit:
```bash
deactivate
```
### Simulation Steps

#### <ins>Pre-Synthesis Simulation</ins>

Run the following command to perform a pre-synthesis simulation:

```bash
cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
mkdir -p output/pre_synth_sim
iverilog -o ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v
```
<img width="1213" height="83" alt="image" src="8.png" />

Then run:
```bash
cd output/pre_synth_sim
./pre_synth_sim.out
```
<img width="894" height="544" alt="image" src="9.png" />

Explanation:

- DPRE_SYNTH_SIM: Defines the PRE_SYNTH_SIM macro for conditional compilation in the testbench.
- The resulting pre_synth_sim.vcd file can be viewed in GTKWave.

#### Viewing Waveform in GTKWave

After running the simulation, open the VCD file in GTKWave: 

```bash

cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
gtkwave output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.vcd

```
Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

<img width="1212" height="766" alt="image" src="10.png" />

In this picture we can see the following signals:

**CLK**: This is the input CLK signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.

**reset**: This is the input reset signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.

**OUT**: This is the output OUT signal of the VSDBabySoC module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.

**RV_TO_DAC[9:0]**: This is the 10-bit output [9:0] OUT port of the RVMYTH core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.

**OUT**: This is a real datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the output wire real OUT signal of the DAC module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally. 

This can be viewed by changing the Data Format of the signal to Analog → Step

#### Viewing DAC output in analog mode

Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC) (as analog step), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

### Trouble shooting tips

   - Module Redefinition: If you encounter redefinition errors, ensure modules are included only once, either in the testbench or in the command line.
   - Path Issues: Verify paths specified with -I are correct. Use full paths if relative paths cause errors.

## Why Pre-Synthesis and Post-Synthesis?

1. **Pre-Synthesis Simulation**: 
   - Focuses only on verifying functionality based on the RTL code.
   - Zero-delay environment, with events occurring on the active clock edge.

2. **Post-Synthesis Simulation (GLS)**:
   - Uses the synthesized netlist (gate-level) to simulate both functionality and timing.
   - Identifies timing violations and potential mismatches (e.g., unintended latches).
   - Helps verify dynamic circuit behavior that static methods may miss.

## VSDBabySoC Post-Synthesis Simulation

Post-synthesis simulation is a critical step in the digital design flow, providing insights into both the functionality and timing of the synthesized design. 

Unlike pre-synthesis simulation, which focuses solely on verifying the functionality based on the RTL code, post-synthesis simulation uses the synthesized netlist to ensure that the design behaves correctly in terms of both logic and timing.

Key aspects of post-synthesis simulation include:

**Functionality and Timing Verification**: It checks the design's functionality and timing using the gate-level netlist, helping identify timing violations and potential mismatches such as unintended latches.

**Dynamic Circuit Behavior**: Post-synthesis simulation can reveal dynamic circuit behaviors that static methods might miss, ensuring the design operates correctly under real-world conditions.

**Identifying Issues**: It helps in identifying issues that may not be apparent in pre-synthesis simulations, such as glitches or race conditions due to the actual gate delays.

The first step in the design flow is to synthesize the generated RTL code, followed by simulating the result. This process helps uncover more about the code and its potential bugs. In this section, we will synthesize our code and then perform a post-synthesis simulation to look for any issues. Ideally, the post-synthesis and pre-synthesis (modeling section) results should be identical, confirming that the synthesis process has not altered the original design behavior.

#### Why do pre-synthesis simulation? Why not just do post-synthesis simulation?
Pre-synthesis simulation is crucial for verifying the logical functionality of a digital design before it undergoes synthesis. It allows designers to detect and correct logical errors, such as incorrect operator usage or unintended latch inference, early in the development process. This type of simulation focuses solely on the high-level behavior of the design, enabling faster iterations and design exploration without the constraints of gate-level details. On the other hand, post-synthesis simulation, or gate-level simulation, is essential for timing verification and ensuring that the synthesized design meets real-world performance requirements. It accounts for gate delays and helps identify any synthesis-induced issues, providing a final validation of both functionality and timing before the design is implemented in hardware. Together, these simulations ensure a robust and reliable digital design.

Here is the step-by-step execution plan for running the  commands manually:
---
### **Step 1: Load the Top-Level Design and Supporting Modules**
- Launch the yosys synthesis tool from your working directory.
```bash
yosys
```
<img width="747" height="476" alt="image" src="13.png" />
 
- Read the main vsdbabysoc.v RTL file into the yosys environment.
```bash
yosys> read_verilog src/module/vsdbabysoc.v 
```
<img width="1214" height="570" alt="image" src="14.png" />

- The following cp commands copy essential header files from the src/include directory into the working directory. These include:

  **sp_verilog.vh** – contains Verilog definitions and macros

  **sandpiper.vh** – holds integration-related definitions for SandPiper

  **sandpiper_gen.vh** – may include auto-generated or tool-generated parameters

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC
cp -r src/include/sp_verilog.vh .
cp -r src/include/sandpiper.vh .
cp -r src/include/sandpiper_gen.vh .
ls
```

<img width="1214" height="580" alt="image" src="15.png" />

- Read the rvmyth.v file with the include path using -I option.
```bash
yosys> read_verilog -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include/ ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/rvmyth.v
```
<img width="1214" height="170" alt="image" src="16.png" />

#### ❗Note:

_If you try to read the rvmyth.v file using yosys without copying the necessary header files first, you may encounter errors.

_To avoid these errors, make sure to copy the required include files into your working directory! This ensures Yosys can resolve them correctly during parsing, even if the -I option is used._

- Read the clk_gate.v file with the include path using -I option.

```bash
yosys> read_verilog -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include/ ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/clk_gate.v
```

<img width="1046" height="523" alt="image" src="17.png" />

### **Step 2: Load the Liberty Files for Synthesis**
Inside the same yosys shell, run:
```bash
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsdpll.lib 
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsddac.lib 
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
<img width="1008" height="262" alt="image" src="18.png" />

### **Step 3: Run Synthesis Targeting `vsdbabysoc`**
```bash
yosys> synth -top vsdbabysoc
```
<img width="1219" height="771" alt="image" src="19.png" />

### **Step 4: Map D Flip-Flops to Standard Cells**

```bash
yosys> dfflibmap -liberty ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
<img width="1216" height="743" alt="image" src="20.png" />

### **Step 5: Perform Optimization and Technology Mapping**
```bash
yosys> opt
yosys> abc -liberty ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib -script +strash;scorr;ifraig;retime;{D};strash;dch,-f;map,-M,1,{D}
```

| Step           | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `strash`       | Structural hashing (reduces logic redundancy)                        |
| `scorr`        | Sequential sweeping for redundancy removal                           |
| `ifraig`       | Incremental FRAIGing (logic equivalence checking and optimization)   |
| `retime;{D}`   | Move registers across combinational logic to optimize timing         |
| `strash`       | Re-run structural hashing after retiming                             |
| `dch,-f`       | Delay-aware combinational optimization with fast mode                |
| `map,-M,1,{D}` | Map logic to gates minimizing area (`-M,1`) and retime-aware (`{D}`) |


<img width="1214" height="739" alt="image" src="21.png" />


<img width="1212" height="740" alt="image" src="22.png" />

### **Step 6: Perform Final Clean-Up and Renaming**

```bash
yosys> flatten
yosys> setundef -zero
yosys> clean -purge
yosys> rename -enumerate
```
| **Command**         | **Purpose / Usage**                                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flatten`           | Flattens the entire design hierarchy into a single-level netlist.                      |
| `setundef -zero`    | Replaces all undefined (`x`) logic values with logical `0` to avoid simulation issues. |
| `clean -purge`      | Removes all unused wires, cells, and modules; `-purge` makes it more aggressive.       |
| `rename -enumerate` | Renames internal wires and cells to unique, numbered names for consistency.            |

<img width="1214" height="744" alt="image" src="23.png" />

### **Step 7: Check Statistics**
```bash
yosys> stat
```
13. Printing statistics.

```
<img width="929" height="196" alt="image" src="24.png" />

## POST_SYNTHESIS SIMULATION AND WAVEFORMS
---

### **Step 1: Compile the Testbench**

Before running the iverilog command, copy the necessary standard cell and primitive models:
These files must be present in the same directory as the testbench (src/module) to resolve all module references during compilation.

You need to have sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop directory you can clone it from this [link](https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop)

```bash
~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module$ cp -r ~/Desktop/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v .
~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module$ cp -r ~/Desktop/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v .
```

To ensure that the synthesized Verilog file _(vsdbabysoc.synth.v)_ is available in the src/module directory for further processing or simulation, you can copy it from the output directory to the src/module directory. Here is the step to do that:
```bash
~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC$ cp -r ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/vsdbabysoc.synth.v ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/
```

Run the following `iverilog` command to compile the testbench:
```bash
iverilog -o ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.out -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v
```

| `-DFUNCTIONAL`                                                             | Defines `FUNCTIONAL` to use behavioral models instead of detailed gate-level timing. |
| `-DUNIT_DELAY=#1`                                                          | Assigns a unit delay of `#1` to all gates for post-synthesis simulation.             |

| `-I /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module`                               | Adds the `module` directory to the include path for additional module references.    |
| `/home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v`                      | Specifies the testbench file as the top-level design for simulation.                 |

## Comparing Pre-Synthesis and Post-Synthesis Output

To ensure that the synthesis process did not alter the original design behavior, the output from the pre-synthesis simulation was compared with the post-synthesis simulation.

Both simulations were run using GTKWave, and the resulting waveforms were observed.

✅ _The outputs match exactly, confirming that the functionality is preserved across the synthesis flow._

_This validates that the synthesized netlist is functionally equivalent to the RTL design._

## Timing Graphs using openSTA

#### Input Files

- `*.v`  : Gate-level Verilog Netlist  
- `*.lib` : Liberty Timing Libraries  
- `*.sdc` : Synopsys Design Constraints (clocks, delays, false paths)  
- `*.sdf` : Annotated Delay File (optional)  
- `*.spef`: Parasitics (RC extraction)  
- `*.vcd` / `*.saif` : Switching Activity for Power Analysis 

#### Clock Modeling Features

- `Generated Clocks`: Derived from existing clocks  
- `Latency`: Clock propagation delay  
- `Source Latency`: Insertion delay from clock source to input  
- `Uncertainty`: Jitter or skew margins  
- `Propagated vs. Ideal`: Real vs. ideal clock network modeling  
- `Gated Clock Checks`: Verifies clocks that are enabled conditionally  
- `Multi-Frequency Clocks`: Analyzes multiple domains  

#### Exception Paths

Timing exceptions refine analysis for real behavior:

- `set_false_path` — Ignores invalid functional paths  
- `set_multicycle_path` — Allows multiple clock cycles  
- `set_max_delay` / `set_min_delay` — Custom timing limits

#### Delay calculation

- `Integrated Dartu/Menezes/Pileggi RC effective capacitance algorithm`

Models effective capacitance for RC networks to compute realistic gate and net delays. It balances accuracy and runtime using an efficient algorithm developed for timing engines.

- `External delay calculator API`
    
Allows plugging in custom delay calculators for advanced or proprietary models (e.g., layout-aware or temperature-adaptive models). Useful for integrating tool flows beyond standard Liberty data.

#### Timing Analysis and Reporting

OpenSTA provides a rich set of commands for analyzing timing paths, delays, and setup/hold checks:

- `report_checks`  
  Reports timing violations across specified paths using options like `-from`, `-through`, and `-to`. Supports multi-path analysis to any endpoint.

  ```tcl
  report_checks -from [get_pins U1/Q] -to [get_pins U2/D]
  ```
#### Timing Paths 

`What do you mean by Timing Paths?`
* It Refer to the logical paths a signal takes through a digital circuit from its source to its destination, including sequential and combinational elements. STA analyzes timing paths to determine their delay, setup and hold times, and other timing parameters specified in the constraints. Timing paths are categorized into combinatorial and sequential, and the critical path is the longest path in the design with the maximum operating frequency.

#### Timing Path Elements
   
Timing path elements in STA are the start point, where a signal originates, the end point, where it terminates, and the combinational logic elements, such as gates, that the signal passes through. Timing paths are traced to determine the overall delay and timing performance of the digital circuit.

**Start Point**: Is the point where the signal originates or enters the digital circuit. This point is typically an input port of the design, where the signal is first introduced to the circuit.

The start point of a timing path can be either:

- An input port, where data enters the design, or

- The clock pin of a register, where data is launched on a clock edge.

**End Point:** Is the point where the signal terminates or leaves the digital circuit. This point is typically an output port of the design, where the signal is outputted from the circuit.

The end point of a timing path can be either:

- A register's data input pin (D pin), where data is captured by the clock edge, or

- An output port, where data must be available at a specific time.

**Combinational Logic:** Combinational logic elements are the building blocks of a digital circuit and are used to perform logic operations on the signals passing through the circuit. These elements do not store any information, and the output of a combinational logic element is solely determined by the input values at that moment.

The diagram illustrates four distinct timing paths:

Path 1: Input to Register (in2reg)

Path 2: Register to Register (reg2reg)

Path 3: Register to Output (reg2out)

Path 4: Input to Output (in2out)

<img width="646" height="521" alt="image" src="29.png" />

#### Setup and Hold Checks

-> **What is Setup Check?**
* Is the minimum time that the data must be stable before the clock edge, and if this time is not met, it can lead to setup violations, resulting in incorrect data being stored in the sequential element. The setup check is essential to ensure correct timing behavior of a digital circuit and prevent data loss or other timing-related issues.
* The setup time of a flip-flop depends on the technology node, operating conditions, and other factors. The value of the setup time is usually provided in the logic libraries.

-> **What is Hold Check?**
* Is the minimum amount of time that the data must remain stable after the clock edge, and if this time is not met, it can lead to hold violations, resulting in incorrect data being stored in the sequential element. The hold check is necessary to prevent issues such as data corruption, metastability, and other timing-related problems in digital circuits.

#### Slack Calculation 

Setup and hold slack is defined as the difference between data required time and data arrivals time. 

>Setup slack = Data required time - Data arrival time

>Hold slack = Data arrival time - Data required time

-> **What is Data Arrival Time?**
* The time taken by the signal to travel from the start point to the end point of the digital circuit. 

-> **What is Data Required Time?** 
* The time for the clock to traverse through the clock path of the digital circuit. 

-> **What is Slack?** 
* It is difference between the desired arrival times and the actual arrival time for a signal. 
* Positive Slack indicates that the design is meeting the timing and still it can be improved. 
* Zero slack means that the design is critically working at the desired frequency. 
* Negative slack means, design has not achieved the specified timings at the specified frequency.
* Slack has to be positive always and negative slack indicates a violation in timing.

#### Common SDC Constraints

In Static Timing Analysis (STA), **Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC)** are used to define the behavior, environment, and timing requirements of a digital design. These constraints are categorized based on their function and purpose.

**Operating Conditions** are set using the `set_operating_conditions` command, which defines the process-voltage-temperature (PVT) corner used during analysis.

**Wire-Load Models** such as `set_wire_load_mode`, `set_wire_load_model`, and `set_wire_load_selection_group` are used to estimate interconnect capacitance and resistance based on fanout and hierarchy when post-layout parasitics are unavailable.

**Environmental Constraints** define the electrical behavior of I/Os. The `set_drive` and `set_driving_cell` commands model input driving strength or source cell characteristics. Output loads are described using `set_load` or `set_fanout_load`. Additional attributes like `set_input_transition` (input slew) and `set_port_fanout_number` (expected output fanout) further refine environment models.

**Design Rule Constraints** ensure physical design adherence. These include `set_max_capacitance` to limit load, `set_max_fanout` to cap number of loads, and `set_max_transition` to restrict slew for signal integrity and EM/IR compliance.

**Timing Constraints** are the core of STA. `create_clock` defines primary clocks, while `create_generated_clock` handles derived clocks. Clock behavior is further detailed using `set_clock_latency`, `set_clock_transition`, and `set_clock_uncertainty`. Timing analysis can be guided with `set_propagated_clock` to consider actual delays, or `set_disable_timing` to ignore specific paths.

Signal timing is modeled using `set_input_delay` and `set_output_delay`. The `set_input_delay` command specifies when input data arrives relative to the clock edge, crucial for setup/hold timing analysis. The `set_output_delay` command defines the required time by which output signals must be valid, helping STA tools verify that data is launched and captured within acceptable timing windows.

**Timing Exceptions** allow control over non-functional or multi-cycle paths. `set_false_path` removes paths from analysis, `set_max_delay` restricts path delay, and `set_multicycle_path` increases the allowed number of clock cycles for timing paths that do not need single-cycle timing closure.

Lastly, **Power Constraints** help manage dynamic and leakage power budgets using `set_max_dynamic_power` and `set_max_leakage_power`. These are especially useful in power-aware synthesis and verification flows.

### VSDBabySoC basic timing analysis

#### Prepare Required Files

To begin static timing analysis on the VSDBabySoC design, you must organize and prepare the required files in specific directories.

```bash
# Create a directory to store Liberty timing libraries

⚠️ **Possible Error Alert**

You may encounter the following error when running the script:

```shell
Warning: /data/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/OpenSTA/examples/timing_libs/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib line 23, default_fanout_load is 0.0.
Warning: /data/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/OpenSTA/examples/timing_libs/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib line 1, library sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80 already exists.
Warning: /data/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/OpenSTA/examples/timing_libs/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib line 23, default_fanout_load is 0.0.
Error: /data/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/OpenSTA/examples/timing_libs/avsdpll.lib line 54, syntax error
```

✅ **Fix:**

This error occurs because Liberty syntax does not support // for single-line comments, and more importantly, the { character appearing after // confuses the Liberty parser. Specifically, check around _line 54 of avsdpll.lib_ and correct any syntax issues such as:

```shell
//pin (GND#2) {
//  direction : input;
//  max_transition : 2.5;
//  capacitance : 0.001;
//}
```
✔️ **Replace with:**
```shell
/*
pin (GND#2) {
  direction : input;
  max_transition : 2.5;
  capacitance : 0.001;
}
*/
```
This should allow OpenSTA to parse the Liberty file without throwing syntax errors.

<img width="284" height="494" alt="image" src="33.png" />

After fixing the Liberty file comment syntax as shown above, you can rerun the script to perform complete timing analysis for VSDBabySoC:

### VSDBabySoC PVT Corner Analysis (Post-Synthesis Timing)
Static Timing Analysis (STA) is performed across various **PVT (Process-Voltage-Temperature)** corners to ensure the design meets timing requirements under different conditions.

### Critical Timing Corners

**Worst Max Path (Setup-critical) Corners:**
- `ss_LowTemp_LowVolt`
- `ss_HighTemp_LowVolt`  
_These represent the **slowest** operating conditions._

**Worst Min Path (Hold-critical) Corners:**
- `ff_LowTemp_HighVolt`
- `ff_HighTemp_HighVolt`  
_These represent the **fastest** operating conditions._

 **Timing libraries** required for this analysis can be downloaded from:

OpenROAD is an open-source, fully automated RTL-to-GDSII flow for digital integrated circuit (IC) design. It supports synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and final layout generation. OpenROAD enables rapid design iterations, making it ideal for academic research and industry prototyping.

### `Steps to Install OpenROAD and Run GUI`

### 1. Clone the OpenROAD Repository

## 🧩 Step 1: Install Prerequisites
Update your system and install core build tools:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake clang g++ gcc git python3 python3-dev \
  libboost-all-dev libtcl tcl-dev tcllib libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison \
  swig libpcre3-dev qtbase5-dev liblemon-dev libspdlog-dev libeigen3-dev libffi-dev \
  pkg-config libjson-c-dev libzstd-dev
```
<img width="731" height="506" alt="image" src="OP01.png" />
<img width="731" height="506" alt="image" src="OP1.png" />

## 📦 Step 2: Clone the Repositories
Install OpenROAD-flow scripts (wrapper for Yosys, OpenROAD, etc.):

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts.git
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts
```

<img width="731" height="506" alt="image" src="OP2.png" />


## ⚙️ Step 3: Run the Setup Script
Run the setup installer (this installs all required third-party libraries):

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```
This step sets up everything OpenROAD depends on — including Boost, SWIG, Abseil, and more.

<img width="739" height="561" alt="image" src="37.png" />


## 🏗️ Step 4: Build OpenROAD Locally
Now build OpenROAD itself using the automated build script:

```bash
./build_openroad.sh --local
```
💡 This step takes about 30–45 minutes depending on cores and RAM.

<img width="739" height="561" alt="image" src="38.png" />

If tests fail to build (common Google Test issue), you can skip them:

```bash
./build_openroad.sh --local --disable-tests
```




## Step 5: Verify Installation

```bash
source ./env.sh
yosys -help  
openroad -help
yosys --version
openroad --version
verilator --version
```

<img width="739" height="553" alt="image" src="39.png" />


## Step 6: Run the OpenROAD Flow

```bash
cd flow
make
```

<img width="739" height="561" alt="image" src="40.png" />


## Step 7. Launch the graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the final layout

```bash
 make gui_final
```

<img width="1847" height="921" alt="image" src="41.png" />


✅ Installation Complete! You can now explore the full RTL-to-GDSII flow using OpenROAD.

# Macro Configuration File Documentation

The `macro.cfg` file defines the placement coordinates and orientation for hardware macros in a chip design layout, typically used in VLSI/ASIC design flows.

## File Format

Each line in the configuration file follows this syntax pattern:

```
<macro_name> <x_coordinate> <y_coordinate> <orientation>
```

## Configuration Breakdown

### PLL Macro
```
pll 200 950 N
```

- **Macro Name**: `pll` (Phase-Locked Loop)
- **X Coordinate**: 200 (horizontal placement position)
- **Y Coordinate**: 950 (vertical placement position)
- **Orientation**: `N` (North - standard upright orientation)

The PLL is a critical clock generation and management circuit positioned at coordinates (200, 950) with standard North orientation.

### DAC Macro
```
dac 150 250 MY
```

- **Macro Name**: `dac` (Digital-to-Analog Converter)
- **X Coordinate**: 150 (horizontal placement position)
- **Y Coordinate**: 250 (vertical placement position)
- **Orientation**: `MY` (Mirror Y - flipped along the Y-axis)

The DAC macro handles digital-to-analog conversion and is placed at coordinates (150, 250) with Y-axis mirroring applied.

## Orientation Values

Common orientation flags include:
- **N**: North (0° rotation, standard)
- **S**: South (180° rotation)
- **E**: East (90° clockwise)
- **W**: West (90° counter-clockwise)
- **MY**: Mirror Y-axis
- **MX**: Mirror X-axis

## Usage

This configuration file is typically consumed by place-and-route tools during the physical design phase to ensure proper macro placement and avoid routing congestion.

## Edit global_route.tcl

The Fix: Comment Out the "Extra" Optimizations
Since we cannot disable this step via config.mk, we must comment it out in the Tcl script. You don't need Power Recovery for this design anyway.

Step 1: Open the Script Open the file global_route.tcl in your text editor. (It is likely located at flow/scripts/global_route.tcl or inside your scripts folder).

Step 2: Comment Out Power Recovery Find the section that looks like this (around line 100-110) and add # to the start of every line to disable it:

```Tcl
# ----------------- COMMENT THIS BLOCK OUT -----------------
# log_cmd global_route -start_incremental
# recover_power_helper
# # Route the modified nets by rsz journal restore
# log_cmd global_route -end_incremental {*}$res_aware \
#   -congestion_report_file $::env(REPORTS_DIR)/congestion_post_recover_power.rpt

### Another Fix thanks to the [@BitopanBaishya](https://github.com/BitopanBaishya)

He modified the macro_place_util.tcl file so that it reads the macro.cfg as follows:

He replaced
```
log_cmd rtl_macro_placer {*}$all_args
```
with
```
  # Manual macro placement using macro.cfg
if { [env_var_exists_and_non_empty MACRO_PLACEMENT_CFG] } {

set fp [open $::env(MACRO_PLACEMENT_CFG) r]
while {[gets $fp line] >= 0} {
# skip empty and comment lines
if {[regexp {^\s*$} $line]} continue
if {[regexp {^#} $line]} continue

# Parse: <macro> <x> <y> <orient>
scan $line "%s %f %f %s" macro x y orient

puts "Placing macro $macro at ($x, $y) orient $orient"
place_macro -macro_name $macro -location "$x $y" -orientation $orient
}
close $fp
}
```

### `Run Floorplan`

```shell
make DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/config.mk floorplan
```
<img width="735" height="527" alt="image" src="49.png" />
<img width="735" height="527" alt="image" src="floorplan.jpg" />

This command initiates the floorplanning process for the `vsdbabysoc` design using the specified configuration file `config.mk` on the `sky130hd` platform.

#### Floorplan Error and Fix

❗**Note:** You may encounter the following error:

```shell
[ERROR STA-0164] .../vsdbabysoc/lib/avsdpll.lib line 54, syntax error
Error: floorplan.tcl, 4 STA-0164
```

**Fix:**
This error is caused by commented block structures in your Liberty file avsdpll.lib. OpenROAD’s parser does not tolerate partially commented blocks like:

```shell
//pin (GND#2) {
//  direction : input;
//  max_transition : 2.5;
//  capacitance : 0.001;
//}
```

✅ To fix it, simply delete the entire commented block starting at line 54:

After saving the changes, re-run the floorplan step and the flow should proceed without syntax errors.

```shell
make DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/config.mk place
```
<img width="735" height="527" alt="image" src="48.png" />
This command executes the placement process for the `vsdbabysoc` design, utilizing the configuration file `config.mk` on the `sky130hd` platform to arrange the circuit components optimally within the defined floorplan.

<img width="1288" height="728" alt="image" src="57.jpg" />

**Routing Result (GUI)**

```shell
make DESIGN_CONFIG=./designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/config.mk gui_route
```
This image shows the **post-routing stage**. The highlighted net `VCO_IN` is fully routed, with its details such as signal type, wire type, and bounding box displayed in the Inspector.

<img width="1919" height="913" alt="image" src="58.jpg" />


<img width="1919" height="912" alt="image" src="59.jpg" />

This image shows the **Routing Congestion Heatmap** after the routing stage. Areas with higher congestion are highlighted in **red**, while green regions indicate lower congestion. The highlighted net `_01595_` is fully routed, and its properties such as bounding box and connectivity details are shown in the Inspector.

<img width="1919" height="917" alt="image" src="60.jpg" />

#### <ins>Formula for Congestion:</ins>

The routing congestion percentage is calculated as:

**Congestion (%) = (Used Routing Tracks ÷ Available Routing Tracks) × 100**

Where:
- **Used Routing Tracks** = Number of tracks occupied by wires in a specific region.
- **Available Routing Tracks** = Total routing capacity of that region.

#### <ins>Techniques to Reduce Routing Congestion:</ins>

1. **Increase Core Area / Die Size**
   - Enlarging the die provides more routing tracks and reduces congestion.
   
2. **Adjust Placement Density**
   - Lower the target density during placement to leave whitespace for routing.
   
3. **Add Placement Blockages**
   - Create routing blockages or halos around macros to avoid routing choke points.
   
4. **Cell Padding**
   - Add extra spacing between standard cells to reduce local congestion.
   
5. **Macro Repositioning**
   - Move large macros toward the periphery and keep enough channel spacing.
   
6. **Use Higher Metal Layers**
   - Assign global nets or critical signals to higher metal layers for better routing resources.
   
7. **Routing Layer Adjustment**
   - Allow more routing layers in congested designs.
   
8. **Congestion-Driven Placement**
   - Enable congestion-aware algorithms during placement in the EDA tool.
     
#### <ins>Timing Report after Routing:<ins>

After completing routing, run the following in the OpenROAD GUI → Scripting window:

```shell
report_checks
```

This command provides a detailed timing analysis of critical paths.

In the example below, the design meets timing with Slack = 5.94 ns (MET)

<img width="1596" height="903" alt="image" src="61.jpg" />

The image shows various **log and JSON files** generated by the OpenROAD flow for each stage (e.g., floorplan, placement, CTS, routing, and filler cell insertion). These files provide detailed execution reports and design data for debugging and analysis.

<img width="1534" height="836" alt="image" src="62.jpg" />

### 🔄 Convert `.odb` to `.def` in OpenROAD

Follow the steps below to export a DEF file from an existing OpenDB (`.odb`) database.

```shell
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
source env.sh
cd flow
openroad
# Load the .odb database file
read_db /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/base/5_2_route.odb
# Write out the DEF file
write_def /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/base/5_2_route.def
```
<img width="1605" height="452" alt="image" src="63.jpg" />

```shell
gvim /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/base/5_2_route.def
```

<img width="1603" height="897" alt="image" src="64.jpg" />

### `VSDBabySoC post_route SPEF generation`

This section covers the step-by-step procedure to generate the **post-route Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF)** and **post-placement Verilog netlist** for the `VSDBabySoC` design using OpenROAD. These outputs are essential for accurate timing analysis and signoff after the routing stage. The SPEF file captures parasitic RC effects from the physical layout, while the updated Verilog reflects the final net connections post-placement and routing.

### `Step 1: Launch OpenROAD`

Before starting OpenROAD, set up the environment and navigate to the flow directory:

```bash
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
source env.sh
cd flow/
openroad
```



### `Step 2: Load Design and Technology Files`

Once inside the OpenROAD shell, run the following commands in sequence to load the required design and technology data for VSDBabySoC:

These files describe the physical dimensions and metal/via layers for standard cells and macros:
```shell
read_lef /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/lef/sky130hd.lef
read_lef /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/lef/avsdpll.lef
read_lef /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/lef/avsddac.lef
```

This file contains timing and power data for the standard cells:
```shell
read_liberty /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/platforms/sky130hd/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

The DEF file represents the post-route physical layout of the design:
```shell
read_def /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/base/5_2_route.def
```

<img width="1598" height="810" alt="image" src="64.jpg" />

### `Step 3: RC Extraction and Output Generation`

After loading the LEF, Liberty, and DEF files, run the following commands to define the process corner and extract parasitics using the available `.calibre`-format model:

#### 🔹 1. Define Process Corner
Set the process corner using the available Calibre-based extraction rules file:

```tcl
define_process_corner -ext_model_index 0 /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/external-resources/open_pdks/sky130/openlane/rules.openrcx.sky130A.nom.calibre
```

#### 🔹 2. Extract Parasitics

Run parasitic extraction using the same file:

```shell
extract_parasitics -ext_model_file /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/external-resources/open_pdks/sky130/openlane/rules.openrcx.sky130A.nom.calibre
```

#### 🔹 3. Write SPEF File
Save the extracted parasitics:

```shell
write_spef /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/vsdbabysoc.spef
```

#### 🔹 4. Write Post-Placement Verilog Netlist
Save the netlist after placement and routing:

```shell
write_verilog /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/vsdbabysoc_post_place.v
```

<img width="738" height="791" alt="image" src="67.png" />

The Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF) file captures the resistance and capacitance (RC) parasitics of interconnects extracted from the routed layout. This file is essential for accurate post-route static timing analysis (STA) as it models real-world wire delays caused by metal layers and vias. Tools like OpenSTA read the SPEF file to compute timing paths that reflect true physical behavior after routing. Generating and inspecting the SPEF ensures that your design is signoff-ready with precise timing estimates.

```shell
gvim /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/vsdbabysoc.spef
```

<img width="1602" height="899" alt="image" src="68.png" />

The post-placement Verilog netlist represents the logical connectivity of the design after placement and routing have been completed. This version of the netlist includes any modifications made by optimization or physical synthesis during the backend flow and ensures consistency with the final layout. It is used in downstream verification flows and enables correlation between logical simulation and physical implementation. Writing this netlist is crucial for timing closure and for validating the final connectivity of the design.

```shell
gvim /home/raheem/Desktop/VLSI/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/vsdbabysoc_post_place.v
```

<img width="1598" height="900" alt="image" src="69.png" />
